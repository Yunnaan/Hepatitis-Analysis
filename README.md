# Hepatitis-Analysis
Welcome to my project on Analysing Hepatitis Data using Python, this repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating an analysis of Hepatitis Data using Python programming language. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and machine learning applied to the dataset.

# Introduction
Hepatitis is a critical health issue worldwide, and analyzing hepatitis data can provide valuable insights for healthcare professionals and researchers. This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating an analysis of hepatitis data using the Python programming language.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the Hepatitis Data from kaggle. The dataset tells about the various symptoms in case of a Hepatitis and whether the person suffering from Hepatitis lived or died.

# key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Data visualization.
- Application of machine learning to predict or classify hepatitis-related outcomes(lived or died).

# Results
The results of the analysis are present in the notebook, each section of the notebook is well explained in detailed
